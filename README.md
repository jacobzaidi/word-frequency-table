Assuming the C\#, F\# and Node compilers are on the current PATH, you may type the following into your terminal.
```
$ csc word-freq-table.cs
$ word-freq-table filename k

$ fsc word-freq-table.fs
$ word-freq-table filename k

$ node word-freq-table.cs filename k
```
to print the k most frequent words, where filename is the text file you are analysing
